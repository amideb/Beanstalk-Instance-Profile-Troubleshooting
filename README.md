## Step 3: Configure Service Access

In "Configure Service Access" step,
-   Choose "Create and use new service role".
-   For "Service role name", type `aws-elasticbeanstalk-service-role`.
- Now, Check the "EC2 Instance Profile and click refresh, If you have created any EC2 Instance profile before with proper permission it will show that, you can select that and click on next. And skip the next step, jump to **Step 4**
- Otherwise Open IAM in a new tab and follow the next **Step 3A**

- Choose the "EC2" use case, and then "Next: Permissions".
- In the Attach permissions policies page, type "AWSElasticBeanstalk" in the search box.
- Check the boxes for "AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier", "AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier", and "AWSElasticBeanstalkMulticontainerDocker".
- Click "Next: Tags" to optionally add tags to the role.
- Click "Next: Review".
-  For Role name, type "aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role" and then click "Create role".

<br>

## Step 7: Open the Application

After the environment is created, Elastic Beanstalk provides you with a URL to your website. If you used the sample application, this will be a simple web page that's served by a Python application running on your environment.
